        "title": "What Is Solana (SOL) and How Does SOL Crypto Work?",
        "content": "What Is Solana (SOL)?\nSolana is a blockchain platform designed to host decentralized, scalable applications. Founded in 2017, it is an open-source project currently run by the Solana Foundation based in Geneva, while the blockchain was built by San Francisco-based Solana Labs.\nSolana is much faster in terms of the number of transactions it can process and has significantly lower transaction fees than rival blockchains like Ethereum. The cryptocurrency that runs on the Solana blockchain—also named Solana (SOL)—soared almost 12,000% in 2021 and, at one point, had a market capitalization of over $75 billion, making it one of the largest cryptocurrencies by this measure at the time. In 2024, SOL remained one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap.\nKey Takeaways\n- Solana is a blockchain platform designed to host decentralized, scalable applications.\n- Solana can process many more transactions per second and charges lower transaction fees than rival blockchains like Ethereum.\n- Solana is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain but improves on it with a mechanism called proof-of-history (PoH), which uses hashed timestamps to verify when transactions occur.\nHistory of Solana\nSolana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko's previous work experience was in the field of distributed systems design with leading technology companies such as Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM). This experience made him aware that a reliable clock simplifies network synchronization, and when that occurs, the resulting network would be exponentially faster, with the only constraint being its bandwidth.\nYakovenko surmised that using proof-of-history would speed up the blockchain tremendously compared with blockchain systems without clocks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These systems struggled to scale beyond 15 transactions per second (TPS) worldwide, a fraction of the throughput handled by centralized payment systems such as Visa (V), which reportedly see peaks of up to 65,000 TPS.\nYakavenko's proof-of-history gets past this hurdle, with every node in the network able to rely on the recorded passage of time.\nProof-of-History Concept\nYakovenko published a white paper in November 2017 describing the proof-of-history (PoH) concept. PoH allows the blockchain to reach consensus by verifying the passage of time between events, and it is used to encode the passage of time into a ledger.\nIn the white paper, Yakovenko notes that blockchains that were then publicly available did not rely on time, with each node in the network relying on its own local clock without knowledge of any other participants' clocks in the network. The lack of a trusted source of time (i.e., a standardized clock) meant that when a message timestamp was used to accept or reject a message, there was no guarantee that every other participant in the network would make an identical choice.\nFast Fact\nSolana also has its own standard for tokenization, SPL Token, similar to Ethereum's ERC-20.\nSolana's Technology\nSolana's design uses algorithms to remove performance bottlenecks caused by blockchain software. This makes it scalable, secure, and decentralized. There is speculation that its architecture might allow for a limit of 710,000 TPS on a standard gigabit network and up to 28.4 million TPS on a 40-gigabit network.\nSolana's blockchain operates on both a proof-of-history (PoH) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model. PoS permits validators (those who validate transactions added to the blockchain ledger) to verify transactions based on how many coins or tokens they hold; PoH allows those transactions to be timestamped and verified very quickly.\nFast Fact\nInstead of validator nodes, Solana uses validator clusters, where groups of validators work together to process transactions.\nSolana vs. Ethereum\nSolana's rapidly expanding ecosystem and versatility have inevitably drawn comparisons to Ethereum, the leading blockchain for decentralized applications (dApps):\n- Smart contracts: Solana and Ethereum have smart contract capabilities, which are crucial for running cutting-edge applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n- Consensus: Solana and Ethereum both use a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where validators stake their cryptocurrency as collateral for the privilege of earning rewards for assisting the blockchain. Solana improves PoS by also implementing PoH.\n- Speed: Much of the buzz surrounding Solana in 2021 was due to its distinct advantage over Ethereum in terms of transaction processing speed and transaction costs. Solana processes more than 2,400 transactions per second (on Sept. 18, 2024), and its average cost per transaction is $0.00026. In contrast, Ethereum can handle fewer than 15 TPS, while average transaction fees are around $0.30.\nEthereum Upgrades\nEthereum has first mover advantage, and with its massive ecosystem, it is second only to Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization. Ethereum's 2022 upgrade, which merged its Beacon Chain and Mainnet Chain, provided the framework for its blockchain to be more scalable, secure, and sustainable. A future upgrade will introduce danksharding, significantly decreasing transaction times and reducing network congestion. How Solana will fare against these improvements is yet to be seen.\nDoes Solana Have a Future?\nSolana has a solid following and is popular with traders and investors. However, it is difficult to say how Solana will end up in the future.\nIs Solana a Buy, Hold, or Sell?\nIt depends on your market outlook, risk tolerance, and investing strategy.\nHow Much Is Solana Worth?\nSolana's (SOL) price changes often, but on Sept. 18, 2024, it was worth about $129.\nThe Bottom Line\nSolana is a blockchain whose purpose, use cases, and capabilities rival (and possibly exceed) that of Ethereum. It is one of the more popular blockchains, and its token, SOL, commands a decent share of the cryptocurrency market.\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Its native cryptocurrency is SOL.\nSolana was launched in 2020 by Solana Labs, which was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal in 2018. The blockchain has experienced several major outages, Solana wallets were subjected to a hack, and a class action lawsuit was filed alleging that Solana sells unregistered securities, and misled investors about the number of tokens. The SEC has also filed a lawsuit against a cryptocurrency exchange alleging that Solana should be regulated as a security.\nCharacteristics\nAccording to the company's white paper, Solana runs on a proof of stake model.[2] The New York Times and Financial Times described the coin as an alternative to Ethereum.[3][4]\nHistory\nSolana was first opened to the public in March 2020,[2] with its first block being created on 16 March 2020.[5] The Solana blockchain was designed to support smart contracts and decentralized apps in particular.[2][6] Large numbers of simultaneous transactions have contributed to several outages of the Solana blockchain.[6]\nIn June 2021, Solana Labs sold $314 million worth of its native cryptocurrency, SOL, to a group of funds led by Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital.[7]\nThe market capitalization of the Solana blockchain surpassed $63 billion in September 2021,[8] and reached $74 billion in early November 2021, having risen by nearly 12,000% that year to a price of $259.96.[2] The blockchain's popularity at this time was due in part to interest in NFTs.[6]\nOn 1 July 2022, a class action lawsuit was filed against Solana Labs. The lawsuit accused Solana of selling unregistered securities tokens in the form of Solana from 24 March 2020, onward and that Solana deliberately misled investors concerning the total circulating supply of SOL tokens. According to the lawsuit, Anatoly Yakovenko, the founder of Solana Labs, lent a market maker more than 11.3 million tokens in April 2020 and failed to disclose this information to the public. The lawsuit claimed that Solana stated it would reduce the supply by this amount, but it only burned 3.3 million tokens.[9]\nOn 3 August 2022, 9,231 Solana wallets were hacked[10] and four Solana wallet addresses stole approximately $8 million from victims.[11] The Solana Foundation said that the hack was caused by digital wallet software from Slope Finance.[11]\nIn November 2022, the price of SOL token dropped by 40 percent in one day following the bankruptcy of FTX, due to sell off from Alameda Research. SOL tokens were Alameda's second-largest holding at the time[12][13] and FTX held $982 million in SOL tokens.[14] By the end of 2022, Solana had lost more than $50 billion in market capitalization since the beginning of the year.[6]\nFrom the start of 2023 until 15 March, coinciding with a rise in the cryptocurrency market, Solana's market capitalization had more than doubled to around $7 billion.[15]\nIn June 2023, the SEC sued Coinbase, alleging that Solana and twelve other currencies offered by the platform failed the Howey Test and qualified as securities. The suit accused Coinbase of illegally evading requirements for disclosure by offering these tokens. The SEC had previously issued a Wells notice to Coinbase in March.[16][17] Solana Foundation has denied that the token is a security.[18] The price of SOL token dropped nearly 30% after this announcement from the SEC, This caused some exchanges to liquidate their holdings, including Robinhood which delisted SOL and other tokens named by the SEC.[19][20]\nIn November 2024, Robinhood Crypto relisted SOL for U.S. customers, alongside several other cryptocurrencies.[21][non-primary source needed]\nIn January 2025, the SOL token reached a new all-time high of $294, following the launch of US President Donald Trump's memecoin.[22]\nOutages\nThe Solana blockchain had experienced several notable outages in service.\nOn 14 September 2021, the Solana blockchain went offline after a surge of transactions caused the network to fork, and different validators had different views of the state of the network. The network was brought back online the next day on 15 September 2021.[23] The outage lasted a total of about 17 hours.[8]\nThe Solana blockchain again went offline on 1 May, with the outage lasting roughly seven hours due to it being taken offline by bots.[24] The blockchain went offline again on 31 May 2022, due to a bug in how the blockchain processes offline transactions. This outage lasted about four and a half hours.[25][26][27]\nOn 1 October 2022, the Solana network went down for 6 hours due to a consensus bug in the validator client allowing a misconfigured node to publish multiple valid but different blocks.[28]\nSolana's outages have frequently resulted in the value of the network's native SOL token falling.[6][29]\nApplication\nIn April 2023, Solana Mobile, a subsidiary of Solana Labs,[30] began selling the Solana Saga, an Android smartphone with several Solana-based decentralized apps preinstalled.[31]\nIn September 2023, Visa announced that along with payment processors Worldpay, Inc. and Nuvei, it had added support for the Solana blockchain to send payments to merchants using the stablecoin USD Coin (USDC), rather than fiat currency via bank wire.[32]\nIn January 2025, Donald Trump launched his memecoin, $TRUMP, using the Solana blockchain, causing a surge of usage of Solana.[22]\nSee also\nReferences\n- ^ \"solana/LICENSE\".
