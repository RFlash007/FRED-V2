        "content": "A surge in demand for artificial intelligence-focused semiconductors and AI-enabled smartphones and laptops could lead to the next global chip shortage, according to a report released Wednesday by consultancy Bain & Co.\nThe last major semiconductor shortage happened during the Covid-19 pandemic amid supply chain disruption and a rise in demand for consumer electronics as people were forced to stay and work at home.\nTechnology giants have been snapping up graphics processing units, or GPUs, mainly from Nvidia. These GPUs which are housed in data centers are critical for the training of huge AI models which underpin applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nMeanwhile, companies like Qualcomm are designing chips that go into smartphones and personal computers and allow those devices to run AI applications locally rather than via an internet connection in the cloud. These are often referred to as AI-enabled devices and companies from Samsung to Microsoft have released such products.\nBain said demand for GPUs and AI consumer electronics could be the cause of a chip shortage.\n\"Surging demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) has caused shortages in specific elements of the semiconductor value chain,\" Anne Hoecker, head of the technology practice in the Americas at Bain, told CNBC by email.\n\"If we combine the growth in demand for GPUs alongside a wave of AI-enabled devices, which could accelerate PC product refresh cycles, there could be more widespread constraints on semiconductor supply.\"\nHowever, it's unclear at this point how much demand such AI-enabled gadgets will have, given what appears to be a cautious approach to them from consumers so far.\nBain noted that the semiconductor supply chain is \"incredibly complex, and a demand increase of about 20% or more has a high likelihood of upsetting the equilibrium and causing a chip shortage.\"\n\"The AI explosion across the confluence of the large end markets could easily surpass that threshold, creating vulnerable chokepoints throughout the supply chain,\" the report added.\nThe semiconductor supply chain is spread across multiple companies. For example, while Nvidia might design its GPUs, they are made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC, in Taiwan. TSMC relies on chipmaking tools from countries around the world, such as the Netherlands. Furthermore, the most cutting-edge chips can only be made at a large scale by TSMC and Samsung Electronics.\nGeopolitics could also be a factor prompting a chip shortage. Semiconductors are seen by governments around the world as strategic technology. The U.S. has been on a campaign, via export restrictions and other sanctions, of trying to restrict China's access to the most advanced chips. Meanwhile, Washington has sought to shore up its own domestic capacity to produce semiconductors.\n\"Geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, and multinational tech companies' decoupling of their supply chains from China continue to pose serious risks to semiconductor supply. Delays in factory construction, materials shortages, and other unpredictable factors could also create pinch points,\" Bain said.",

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is raising concerns about a new global semiconductor shortage, with experts offering diverse perspectives on its timing, scope and impact on supply chains, consumer markets and innovation.\nA new report from Bain and Company warns of surging demand for AI-focused chips and AI-enabled devices outstripping supply. This scenario echoes recent shortages that hampered industries from automaking to consumer electronics, highlighting AI’s growing influence on global commerce.\n“AI-driven chip shortages could significantly impact the availability and pricing of AI-enabled electronics, disrupt supply chains in AI-reliant industries and slow innovation in AI products, ultimately affecting global commerce,” Robert Khachatryan, CEO of Freight Right Global Logistics, told PYMNTS.\nWhen a Shortage Might Hit\nThe scale of chip demand is substantial. In 2023, advanced AI chips sold for approximately $40,000 each, with solid demand for over a million units. Projections suggest the global market for AI chips could experience rapid growth, potentially increasing in valuation by $85-95 billion annually by 2025.\nSome in the industry share this perspective.\n“A chip shortage could drive up prices and limit the availability of AI-enabled electronics,” Labhesh Patet, co-founder and CEO of the AI company Autonomys, told PYMNTS. He said that increasing semiconductor demand, current supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions like U.S. restrictions on China’s access to advanced chips will likely raise production costs for AI-powered devices.\nNot all experts agree on the immediacy of the threat.\n“The shortage is coming, but it might not be as soon as many fear. We shouldn’t expect a big effect on the pricing and availability of electronics. The demand for AI-enabled electronics is simply not big enough yet, and it has been decreasing since COVID-19,” Antanas Laurutis, CEO of Altechna, told PYMNTS.\nBroader market dynamics support this view.\n“The demand is also slowly decreasing or at a stagnant phase,” Laurutis said.\nIndustry Impacts\neCommerce is vulnerable to AI chip shortages. Advanced AI models analyze user data — like browsing patterns and purchase history — to understand consumer behavior and predict future actions. This technology enables hyper-personalized shopping experiences that can appeal to consumers.\nSemiconductor shortages could hinder companies’ ability to upgrade or maintain these AI systems. The potential consequences include decreased operational efficiency, slower response times and harm to customer satisfaction.\nSome experts see potential mitigating factors. The CHIPS Act and the shift of chip manufacturing back to the U.S. could play a role.\n“We believe that by the time the surge of demand and this shortage happens, it will already be produced free from China influence, reducing the impact of expected shortages for AI-reliant industries,” Laurutis said.\nOpinions also diverge on the likelihood of an innovation slowdown. The time required to build new manufacturing facilities could slow the race to AI dominance, potentially delaying the development and deployment of AI technologies. This concern is particularly acute given the experience of the global chip shortage from 2020 to 2023.\nA prolonged chip shortage could have far-reaching consequences. Industries like eCommerce, manufacturing and logistics rely heavily on AI-powered technologies that require advanced semiconductors to keep improving. If chips become more challenging to obtain, it could stall the development of new AI tools, disrupt business operations and make it harder for companies to stay agile, potentially affecting markets worldwide.\nContrasting views suggest market forces might prevent prolonged shortages.\n”Overall, the market dictates the demand; it self-regulates. And when technological maturity and real market demand are reached, capital will ensure that the shortage doesn’t last too long and doesn’t slow down innovation,” Laurutis said.",

    "summary": "[Published: Sep 25, 2024] Surging demand for AI-focused semiconductors and AI-enabled devices (such as smartphones and laptops) is driving a potential global chip shortage in 2024–2025. GPUs are experiencing significant supply constraints due to a 20%+ increase in demand, threatening the equilibrium of the semiconductor value chain. TSMC and Samsung remain the only entities capable of mass-producing cutting-edge chips at scale. Geopolitical tensions, U.S. export restrictions on China’s access to advanced semiconductors, delays in factory construction, materials shortages, and supply chain decoupling from China create major pinch points. The AI explosion across key end markets could surpass current capacity thresholds, creating vulnerable chokepoints. Bain & Co. warns that surging GPU demand has already caused disruptions in specific segments of the semiconductor supply chain. The global supply chain spans multiple countries—TSMC (Taiwan) produces Nvidia GPUs, chipmaking tools come from the Netherlands, and components are sourced globally. There is a high risk of widespread semiconductor constraints if AI demand continues to grow rapidly.\nTechCrunch | https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/25/surging-ai-demand-could-cause-the-worlds-next-chip-shortage-report.html\n\n[Published: Sep 27, 2024] The global AI chip market is projected to grow by $85–95 billion annually by 2025, with demand exceeding 1 million units in 2023—chips sold at approximately $40,000 per unit. Experts warn that AI-driven chip shortages could disrupt availability, inflate pricing, and slow innovation across global commerce. While some analysts (e.g., Antanas Laurutis of Altechna) believe the shortage is not imminent due to current demand levels being insufficient, others (like Robert Khachatryan of Freight Right Global Logistics and Labhesh Patet of Autonomys) emphasize that shortages could delay AI system upgrades, reduce efficiency, and harm customer satisfaction in sectors like eCommerce. Geopolitical tensions—especially U.S. export controls on China—are increasing production costs for AI devices. The CHIPS Act and expanded U.S.-based chip manufacturing may reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains by 2025–2026. However, long lead times for new fabrication facilities could cause innovation slowdowns. Historical precedent from the 2020–2023 global chip shortage shows how such disruptions delayed AI deployment and impacted multiple industries. Despite concerns about strain, experts disagree on timing (imminent vs. delayed) and scale of future shortages.\nPYMNTS.com | https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2024/ai-chip-demand-surge-sparks-debate-on-future-shortages",
