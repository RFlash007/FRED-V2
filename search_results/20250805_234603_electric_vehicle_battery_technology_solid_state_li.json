Many expected the market to keep up its pace and grow from strength to strength in 2023. However, faltering sales and raw material supply expansions produced a year characterised by tumbling spot prices.\nCell producers entered 2024 to a market almost unrecognisable from that of a year ago. But while spot prices for key battery materials plunged, regulation updates could reignite EV demand.\nWith EVs front and centre of global geopolitics, we expect 2024 to be a defining year for transport electrification. In this report from our Electric Vehicle & Battery Supply Chain Service, we pick out the five things we’ll watching closely in the year ahead. Fill in the form to access the full report, and read on for a short introduction.\nEV policies in the spotlight for the US elections\nPolicies around EVs will be a major campaign point for the leading candidates as the 2024 US presidential election race reaches its final stretch.\nWhile Democrats will tout the benefits of new job growth in the ‘battery belt’ and reduced pollution, we expect Republican candidates to continue to counter with claims of reduced purchasing freedom for US individuals and indirect benefits for rival Chinese entities.\nRead the full report for a closer look at the policy divide and potential impacts.\nEV brands jostle for position in key markets\nChina has moved headfirst towards EVs as part of its aim to become a high-end goods manufacturing powerhouse. The market dominance of foreign automakers like VW and Toyota have rapidly eroded in China as a result.\nMeanwhile, we see 2024 as an important year to gauge the growth potential of the European EV market as the European Commission completes its anti-subsidy probe on China-origin EVs. Countervailing duties on Chinese imports are undoubtedly in the cards.\nWhat does all of this mean for Chinese and European EV brands in key markets? And could South Korean cell producers emerge as an unexpected winner? Read more on this in the full report.\nCellmakers to expand chemistry options\nThere appears to have been a surplus of over 200 GWh of lithium-ion batteries in China alone last year. Automakers are likely sitting on secured cell supply for EV sales that failed to materialise.\nStoring batteries is an expensive business, so automakers may have a more cautious appetite for purchasing cells in 2024. Along with reducing battery raw materials prices, 2024 should see highly competitive battery prices, leading some to diversify their cell chemistries.\nChina is poised to spearhead the development of more affordable cells, exploring sodium-ion as the next low-cost tech. Large-scale commercialisation of sodium-ion cells is already underway, with BYD initiating construction at its inaugural 30 GWh factory earlier this month.\nFor more on this, plus a look at why 2024 will be a decisive year for low-cost batteries, read the full report.",

Demand for EV batteries reached more than 750 GWh in 2023, up 40% relative to 2022, though the annual growth rate slowed slightly compared to in 2021‑2022. Electric cars account for 95% of this growth. Globally, 95% of the growth in battery demand related to EVs was a result of higher EV sales, while about 5% came from larger average battery size due to the increasing share of SUVs within electric car sales.\nThe United States and Europe experienced the fastest growth among major EV markets, reaching more than 40% year-on-year, closely followed by China at about 35%. Nevertheless, the United States remains the smallest market of the three, with around 100 GWh in 2023, compared to 185 GWh in Europe and 415 GWh in China. In the rest of the world, battery demand growth jumped to more than 70% in 2023 compared to 2022, as a result of increasing EV sales.\nIn China, PHEVs accounted for about one-third of total electric car sales in 2023 and 18% of battery demand, up from one-quarter of total sales in 2022 and 17% of sales in 2021. PHEV batteries are smaller than those used in BEVs, thereby contributing less to increasing battery demand. In recent years, Chinese carmakers have also been marketing more extended-range EVs (EREVs), which use an electric motor as their unique powertrain but have a combustion engine that can be used to recharge the battery when needed. EREVs typically have a battery size about twice that of a PHEV, enabling a real-world electric range of around 150 km compared to 65 km for traditional PHEVs. With an ICE on board, EREVs can reach ranges of around 1 000 km when needed. In 2023, EREVs accounted for 25% of PHEV sales in China, up from about 15% in 2021-2022. Negligible EREV sales are recorded in other regions.\nElectric vehicle battery demand by region, 2016-2023\nOpenMore batteries means extracting and refining greater quantities of critical raw materials, particularly lithium, cobalt and nickel\nRising EV battery demand is the greatest contributor to increasing demand for critical metals like lithium. Battery demand for lithium stood at around 140 kt in 2023, 85% of total lithium demand and up more than 30% compared to 2022; for cobalt, demand for batteries was up 15% at 150 kt, 70% of the total. To a lesser extent, battery demand growth contributes to increasing total demand for nickel, accounting for over 10% of total nickel demand. Battery demand for nickel stood at almost 370 kt in 2023, up nearly 30% compared to 2022.\nHigh levels of investment in mining and refining in the past 5 years have ensured that global supply can comfortably meet demand today, not only for EVs but also in historical markets including portable electronics, ceramics, metals and alloys. In 2023, the supply of cobalt and nickel exceeded demand by 6.5% and 8%, and supply of lithium by over 10%, thereby bringing down critical mineral prices and battery costs. While low critical mineral prices help bring battery costs down, they also imply lower cash flows and narrower margins for mining companies. Compared to just a few years earlier, overcapacity means that many companies are now struggling to stay afloat (see later section on trends in the EV industry). Mining and refining will need to continue growing quickly to meet future demand, to avoid supply chain bottlenecks and make supply chains more resilient to potential disruptions. Doing so will also require striking a balance between remaining profitable while competing on prices. Innovative technologies such as sodium-ion batteries can potentially mitigate demand for critical minerals, together with the rise of mature battery chemistries requiring lower amounts of critical metals, such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP).\nBattery production is located close to demand centres, with international partnerships playing an important role in global expansion\nThe majority of battery demand for EVs today can be met with domestic or regional production in China, Europe and the United States. However, the share of imports remains relatively large in Europe and the United States, meeting more than 20% and more than 30% of EV battery demand, respectively. China is the world’s largest EV battery exporter, with around 12% of its EV batteries being exported.\nProduction in Europe and the United States reached 110 GWh and 70 GWh of EV batteries in 2023, and 2.5 million and 1.2 million EVs, respectively. In Europe, the largest battery producers are Poland, which accounted for about 60% of all EV batteries produced in the region in 2023, and Hungary (almost 30%). Germany leads the production of EVs in Europe and accounted for nearly 50% of European EV production in 2023, followed by France and Spain (with just under 10% each).\nBattery production in China is more integrated than in the United States or Europe, given China’s leading role in upstream stages of the supply chain. China represents nearly 90% of global installed cathode active material manufacturing capacity and over 97% of anode active material manufacturing capacity today. The only countries with significant shares of cathode active material manufacturing capacity outside of China today are Korea (9%) and Japan (3%). Different supply chains are, however, required for different chemistries. China is home to almost 100% of the LFP production capacity and more than three-quarters of the installed lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) and other nickel-based chemistries production capacity, compared to 20% in Korea. LFP is the most prevalent chemistry in the Chinese electric car market, while NMC batteries are more common in the European and American electric car markets.\nChina’s current leading role in battery production, however, comes at the cost of high levels of overcapacity. In 2023, excluding portable electronics, China used less than 40% of its maximum cell output,1 and cathode and anode active material installed manufacturing capacity was almost 4 and 9 times greater than global EV cell demand in 2023. To take advantage of some of this excess capacity, China is the biggest exporter of EV cells, cathodes and anodes globally. However, this has significantly decreased producers’ margins, which may put some at risk if they do not find enough customers outside of China.\nGlobal trade flows for lithium-ion batteries and electric cars, 2023\nIn 2023, the installed battery cell manufacturing capacity was up by more than 45% in both China and the United States relative to 2022, and by nearly 25% in Europe. If current trends continue, backed by policies like the US IRA, by the end of 2024, capacity in the United States will be greater than in Europe. As manufacturing capacity expands in the major electric car markets, we expect battery production to remain close to EV demand centres through to 2030, based on the announced pipeline of battery manufacturing capacity expansion as of early 2024.\nAt the same time, international co-operation and trade in battery technologies will continue to underpin EV market expansion. Just as for current capacity, announcements for additional EV battery manufacturing capacity in Europe and the United States are primarily made by foreign companies headquartered in Asia. Korean companies, for example, account for over 350 GWh in manufacturing capacity outside Korea, Japanese companies for 57 GWh outside Japan, and Chinese companies for just under 30 GWh outside China. About 75% of existing European manufacturing capacity is owned by Korean companies, with LG’s plant in Poland accounting for 50% alone. Capacity in the United States is currently led by four companies: Tesla, Panasonic, SKI and LG. China’s capacity is slightly more fragmented across different manufacturers, but the three largest producers – CATL, BYD and Gotion – account for nearly 50% of domestic capacity.\nRegional EV lithium-ion battery manufacturing capacity by manufacturer headquarters, 2023\nOpenBattery prices\nElectric vehicle battery prices start falling again\nStabilising critical mineral prices led battery pack prices to fall in 2023\nTurmoil in battery metal markets led the cost of Li-ion battery packs to increase for the first time in 2022, with prices rising to 7% higher than in 2021. However, the price of all key battery metals dropped during 2023, with cobalt, graphite and manganese prices falling to lower than their 2015-2020 average by the end of 2023. This led to an almost 14% fall in battery pack price between 2023 and 2022, despite lithium carbonate prices at the end of 2023 still being about 50% higher than their 2015-2020 average. The last year in which battery price experienced a similar price drop was 2020.\nPrice of selected battery materials and lithium-ion batteries, 2015-2024\nOpenIn relative terms, the LFP chemistry was most affected by the surge in battery mineral prices in the last two years. Lithium is the only critical mineral in LFP, and its price grew more than that of other minerals, and remained above historical averages for longer. In comparison, NMC batteries were less than 25% more expensive than their LFP equivalents in 2023, down from a premium of 50% in 2021. LFP batteries remain significantly cheaper than NMC, and their price has recently decreased rapidly.\nFurther innovation-driven improvements are foreseen for both chemistries through recent battery pack configurations, such as cell-to-pack2 (already being adopted for LFP) and cell-to-chassis. In addition, continued innovation in manufacturing is helping to achieve improved battery performance, for example through multi-layer electrodes enabling ultra-fast charging. Efforts to increase the manganese content of both NMC and LFP are also underway, with the aim of either increasing energy density while keeping costs low (LFP) or reducing cost while maintaining high energy density (NMC).\nIn terms of regional competitiveness, batteries are cheapest in China, followed by North America, Europe and other Asia-Pacific countries. However, battery prices across regions, including both batteries produced locally and imports, have been converging in the past few years, indicating that EV batteries are moving towards becoming a truly globalised product.\nNonetheless, battery manufacturing in Europe and the United States remains more expensive than in China. For example, producing a battery cell in the United States is nearly 20%3 more expensive than in China, even when assuming that material costs do not vary regionally. In reality, Chinese manufacturers are likely to benefit from preferential prices from local material producers and a more integrated supply chain within China, which could mean the manufacturing cost gap is even larger. Moreover, contrary to the United States and Europe, most Chinese batteries are LFP, which is more than 20% cheaper to produce than NMC.\nBattery price index by selected region, 2020-2023\nOpenThe battery industry is accelerating plans to develop more affordable chemistries and novel designs\nOver the last five years, LFP has moved from a minor share to the rising star of the battery industry, supplying more than 40% of EV demand globally by capacity in 2023, more than double the share recorded in 2020. LFP production and adoption is primarily located in China, where two-thirds of EV sales used this chemistry in 2023. The share of LFP batteries in EV sales in Europe and the United States remains below 10%, with high-nickel chemistries still most common in these markets.\nLFP was first invented in the United States in 1997, and further developed in Canada through the early 2000s, but thanks to a favourable intellectual property agreement, China has been the only country mass-producing LFP batteries since the 2010s. In 2022, the core LFP patents expired, sparking interest in production outside of China. The recent surge in interest in LFP chemistries has led to major investments in Morocco, which is home to the world’s largest phosphate reserves and, importantly, holds free-trade agreements with the United States and Europe. In 2022, Morocco saw almost as many announced investments to as in the five previous years combined, reaching USD 15.3 billion. Many of these investments were made by battery industry players (e.g. Gotion, LG, CNGR Advanced Material).\nShare of battery capacity of electric vehicle sales by chemistry and region, 2021-2023\nOpenFurther declines in battery cost and critical mineral reliance might come from sodium-ion batteries, which can be produced using similar production lines to those used for lithium-ion batteries. The need for critical minerals like nickel and manganese for sodium-ion batteries depends on the cathode chemistry used, but no sodium-ion chemistries require lithium. Similarly to LFP, sodium-ion batteries were initially developed in the United States and Europe, but today the announced sodium-ion manufacturing capacity in China is estimated to be about ten times higher than in the rest of the world combined. Manufacturing capacity outside China is still at the laboratory or pilot scale.\nIn 2023, leading battery manufacturers announced expansion plans for sodium-ion batteries, such as BYD, Northvolt and CATL, which initially sought to reach mass production by the end of the same year. If brought to scale, sodium-ion batteries could cost up to 20% less than incumbent technologies and be suitable for applications such as compact urban EVs and power stationary storage, while enhancing energy security.\nThe development and cost advantages of sodium-ion batteries are, however, strongly dependent on lithium prices, with current low prices discouraging investments in sodium-ion and delaying expansion plans. Supply chain bottlenecks, such as for high-quality cathode and anode materials specific to sodium-ion batteries, could also hinder near-term expansion.\nReferences\nMaximum output refers to an average utilisation factor of 85%.\nBattery packs used in EVs are typically made of a series of modules, each containing several battery cells.

    "summary": "[Published: 2024-01-23] China had over 200 GWh surplus of lithium-ion batteries in 2023; BYD launched a 30 GWh sodium-ion cell factory in early 2024, signaling large-scale commercialisation of sodium-ion cells is underway. Battery raw material spot prices plummeted in 2023, leading to highly competitive battery pricing in 2024 due to oversupply and reduced demand. Automakers face high storage costs from unsold EVs, reducing appetite for new cell purchases. China leads low-cost battery innovation via sodium-ion technology. While solid-state lithium is not mentioned, the context indicates continued focus on alternative chemistries beyond conventional lithium-ion.\nWoodMac | https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/ev-and-battery-supply-chain-2024-outlook/\n\n[Published: 2025-01-01] EV battery demand reached 750 GWh in 2023, up 40% YoY; lithium demand for batteries was 140 kt (+>30% YoY), with supply surplus exceeding 10%. Battery pack prices fell 14% from 2022 to 2023 despite high lithium carbonate costs. LFP chemistry accounted for over 40% of global EV battery capacity in 2023, up from <20% in 2020; China’s EV sales are two-thirds LFP-based. Sodium-ion battery manufacturing capacity in China is ~10× that of the rest of the world combined, with mass production plans by BYD, CATL, and Northvolt. Sodium-ion batteries could cost up to 20% less than Li-ion if scaled, suitable for urban EVs and stationary storage. The US expects battery cell manufacturing capacity to exceed Europe’s by end of 2024 under current IRA policy support. LFP production is >20% cheaper than NMC; the price gap between NMC and LFP narrowed from 50% (2021) to <25% (2023). Overcapacity in China—cathode capacity ~4× global EV cell demand, anode ~9×—is pressuring margins. The IEA notes that supply chain bottlenecks for high-quality cathode and anode materials specific to sodium-ion batteries could hinder near-term expansion. Sodium-ion may scale by 2025–2026 if lithium prices rise or supply constraints emerge. Battery production is becoming increasingly regionalized, with strong domestic capacity in the US/EU/China.\nIEA | https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/trends-in-electric-vehicle-batteries",
