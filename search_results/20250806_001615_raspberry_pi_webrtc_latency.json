    "summary": "[Published: 2022-05-09] Raspberry Pi can achieve ~200ms low-latency WebRTC video streaming using native WebRTC with V4L2 hardware H.264 and OpenH264 software encoding. Supports P2P, SFU broadcasting, Home Assistant integration, and two-way audio/data communication. Uses MQTT or WebSocket for signaling; requires Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, 3B, 4B, or 5 with CSI/USB camera support. Hardware acceleration is enabled only on Pi Zero 2W, 3B, and 4B—must remove `--hw-accel` flag for Pi 5. Includes features like snapshot recording, WHEP via Nginx proxy, virtual camera streaming, and running as a Linux service.\nGitHub - TzuHuanTai/RaspberryPi-WebRTC | https://github.com/TzuHuanTai/RaspberryPi-WebRTC\n\n[Published: 2024-04-15] Testing shows that WebRTC delivers low-latency video streaming on Raspberry Pi 5, with a target latency of ~200ms. The article compares UDP, TCP, RTSP, and WebRTC for live-streaming applications, emphasizing the importance of minimal delay in real-time control scenarios like FPV drones, remote-controlled vehicles, or robotics. While protocol details are not explained, WebRTC is positioned as a top contender for achieving low-latency performance.\nMedium | https://gektor650.medium.com/comparing-video-stream-latencies-raspberry-pi-5-camera-v3-a8d5dad2f67b",
