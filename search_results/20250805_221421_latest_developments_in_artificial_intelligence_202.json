    "summary": "OpenAI has launched free and customizable AI models to compete with Meta and DeepSeek, while also implementing safeguards—such as preventing ChatGPT from advising users to end relationships. Google is developing a \"world model\" to train AI robots in virtual warehouses, and big tech companies have invested $155 billion in AI this year, with plans to spend hundreds of billions more. The UK’s Productivity Commission is examining whether major tech firms should be allowed to use Australians’ text and data for AI training. Sweden's prime minister faces backlash for using an AI assistant in official duties, and concerns are rising about AI-driven therapy chatbots potentially worsening mental health crises. Demis Hassabis of DeepMind predicts the AI revolution will surpass the Industrial Revolution in scale and speed. The Guardian also covers ethical issues around AI-generated content, including a fabricated interview with a Parkland shooting victim.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai\n\nTechCrunch provides ongoing coverage of artificial intelligence advancements, focusing on generative AI technologies such as large language models, text-to-image and text-to-video systems, speech recognition, and predictive analytics. The platform tracks innovations from leading companies in the field and highlights ethical challenges emerging alongside rapid development.\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/",
