        "content": "Notes\nUnless this report indicates otherwise, all years referred to are federal fiscal years, which run from October 1 to September 30 and are designated by the calendar year in which they end. The Congressional Budget Office has corrected this report since its original publication. Corrections are listed at the end of the report.\nSummary\nArtificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks that have traditionally required human intelligence, such as learning and performing other activities that require cognitive ability. A general attribute of AI is its ability to identify patterns and relationships and to respond to queries that arise in complex scenarios for which the precise computational algorithm that is needed cannot be specified in advance.\nBecause AI has the potential to change how businesses and the federal government provide goods and services, it could affect economic growth, employment and wages, and the distribution of income in the economy. Such changes could in turn affect the federal budget. The direction of those effects—whether they increased or decreased federal revenues or spending—along with their size and timing, are uncertain. Some budgetary effects could occur relatively quickly, whereas others might take longer. In this report, the Congressional Budget Office provides an overview of the channels through which the adoption of AI could affect the U.S. economy and the federal budget.\nHow Might Artificial Intelligence Affect the Economy?\nBy increasing efficiency, enabling the development of new products, and altering the demand for workers, AI has the potential to change the economy, perhaps in ways that are difficult to predict. Whether or when those changes might occur is very uncertain. Surveys show that only 5 percent of businesses in the United States currently rely on AI to produce goods and services. For many businesses, customizing AI to their specific needs is costly, and it is unclear when those costs might fall. As a result, the use of AI is concentrated among larger, and younger, businesses in a few sectors of the economy—although that could change over time as profitable use of the technology became less dependent on a business’s size.\nResearch into the performance of businesses that have implemented AI is still in its early stages, so conclusions from that research, which vary widely among studies, should be considered preliminary. So far, the research has found that businesses that implement AI can be expected to become more productive than businesses that do not. Extrapolation of those results to the broader economy suggests that if AI’s use became more widespread, it would boost economic growth. Evidence for AI’s impact on employment and wages is also sparse and varies by type of AI. Studies of generative AI indicate that it could enhance the productivity of low-skilled workers within a given occupation; studies of earlier forms of the technology have found that AI boosted the wages of some skilled workers.\nHow Might Artificial Intelligence Affect the Federal Budget?\nThe use of AI could affect the federal budget through two basic channels: the economy and the government. Within each channel, AI could have an impact on revenues and spending. The timing of budgetary effects may vary.\nAI’s Use in the Economy. The use of AI could affect the overall amount of income in the economy and its distribution among businesses, investors, and workers. An increase in income would, by itself, eventually push up federal revenues. Initially, however, revenues could decline as businesses deducted from their income the cost of initial investments in the technology. Moreover, because different categories of income are taxed at different rates, changes to how income is distributed among workers and businesses could alter federal revenues. In particular, depending on how the demand for workers shifted in response to the use of AI, tax receipts tied to labor income could rise or fall. For workers who were left permanently unemployed or who took lower-paying jobs because of businesses’ adoption of new technology, income and payroll taxes could decline; however, workers who were made more productive by AI could earn higher wages and remit larger tax payments. To the extent that AI created new kinds of tasks and jobs or led to economic growth through innovation, it could offset some potential losses of wages and taxes by increasing the demand for labor.\nAI’s use in the economy could change both mandatory spending (which does not require annual funding from the Congress) and spending subject to appropriation (which requires annual funding from the Congress). For instance, mandatory spending could increase to the extent that workers whose jobs were displaced by AI claimed benefits from federal income-support programs. But if AI boosted economic output and earnings, then such spending could decrease.\nAI could also have an impact on federal spending through its use in the development of certain products, such as pharmaceuticals. For example, mandatory spending could increase to the extent that new drugs were paid for by federally subsidized health care programs. But that spending could decrease to the extent that the new drugs reduced the demand for other, more expensive, health care services. For AI’s use in other types of health care that receive a federal subsidy and are provided by the private sector, the ultimate impact is often unclear. In general, if AI’s use enabled individuals to live longer, healthier lives, then it could boost federal revenues and spending in the long term. Revenues would be higher if more taxes were paid over a longer period. Spending would be greater if more claims were made on Social Security, Medicare, and other programs by individuals who lived longer in retirement than they would have otherwise.\nSpending subject to appropriation could increase if the Congress expanded funding for AI’s continued development by the public and private sectors. That could happen through federal programs for research and development (R&D) as well as through programs that regulate the technology’s use.\nAI’s Use by the Government. The government’s use of AI could change the amount of revenues collected through taxes and other sources. Federal revenues could rise, for example, if the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was able to use AI to bolster its auditing capability and taxpayers’ compliance with the federal tax code. By contrast, revenues would decline if businesses or individuals were able to use AI tools to reduce the taxes they owed.\nThe government’s use of AI could also have various effects on mandatory spending and spending subject to appropriation. In particular, successful use of AI to reduce fraud could result in fewer improper payments in the largest mandatory spending programs: Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Those efforts could be undermined, however, if individuals used the technology to perpetrate fraud.\nAI could affect the spending subject to appropriation of federal agencies that made use of the technology. Although investments in AI might initially increase spending, those costs could eventually decline, depending on the efficiencies that were realized. For example, if AI substituted for labor, staffing requirements could fall.\nDevelopment and Use of Artificial Intelligence\nThe past few decades have seen rapid strides in AI’s capabilities. Today, AI is embedded in commonly used software (such as web browsers, phones, and home assistants) and found in more specialized applications (such as industrial robots and self-driving cars). Although recent advances in AI have fostered optimism that significant further progress is imminent, several factors could hinder the technology’s near-term development and use. In particular, a lack of large datasets to train AI models could restrict improvements in accuracy and applicability. In addition, obstacles to obtaining the energy needed to power advanced AI systems could impede their use.\nAdvances in AI Systems\nMachine learning techniques underlie most forms of AI today. Discriminative AI models, for example, can distinguish between different types of images, such as cancerous and noncancerous human cells, on the basis of the characteristics that they have been trained to associate with each type. Human intervention is necessary both to select the initial computational algorithm (or mathematical model) and training data and, ultimately, to assess the AI system’s performance. The output of an AI model, then, is fundamentally a prediction of the correct response to a particular question or to a new set of conditions.\nThe most advanced AI systems are composed of neural networks that are made up of thousands or even millions of nodes where computation takes place. Deep-learning AI consists of dozens of layers of nodes, and information can be exchanged between individual nodes and between layers. A general attribute of such systems, which are typically trained on very large datasets, is their ability to identify relationships and respond to queries that arise in scenarios in which the needed computational algorithm cannot be specified in advance.\nGenerative AI systems can, upon receiving a question or prompt from users, provide answers and other types of content that are comparable to what would have been produced by a person. For example, large language models generate human-like text and perform natural language processing in which machines are able to understand and interact with human speech. Large language models rely on data collected from public internet sites, and they generate responses to user queries in the form of text or, where applicable, computer code. Those models are based on what is known as the transformer architecture, which is a deep-learning neural network that transforms an input sequence into an output sequence.1 Other generative AI systems can produce user-specified images, video, and music—even in the style of specific artists, if desired.\nThe current capabilities of AI systems reflect several decades of dramatic advances. An early, and highly touted, application of AI was IBM’s Deep Blue, a computer capable of playing chess. That system beat world chess champion Gary Kasparov in a series of matches in the late 1990s. That application of AI was relatively rudimentary in that it relied on substantial human input to learn the rules and various strategies of chess and to improve its performance. In 2016, a more advanced system, based on neural networks, defeated one of the world’s top players of Go, which is a board game considered much more challenging than chess.\nOther types of AI also have displayed rapid progress. For example, discriminative AI—which learns the boundaries between different classes of input data to identify (or categorize) them correctly—achieved a breakthrough at the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge of 2012. In particular, by applying neural networks trained on a large dataset of images, one of the AI models competing in the challenge (AlexNet) achieved a very high degree of accuracy in recognizing images.2 AI systems have continued to advance since then, and the performance of leading models on multitask tests has increased markedly over just the past few years.3\nNear-Term Obstacles to Further AI Development\nDespite recent rapid gains in the capability and accessibility of AI systems, the technology’s history suggests that further progress could be interrupted. The field of AI research dates from the mid-1950s, and on more than one occasion, improvements in the technology heralded as breakthroughs have not led to follow-on success.\nRecent advances in AI are attributed to the availability of large datasets and abundant power—in terms of both computer processing capability and the supply of energy—along with the development of increasingly complex computing algorithms. Some research suggests that AI could become widely used. However, in the near term, the adoption of AI also faces various obstacles.\nOne particular concern about wider adoption of AI is the looming scarcity of additional large datasets—containing either general, or task-specific, information—for training AI models. An additional concern is the ability of the electric power sector in the United States to supply sufficient electricity for powering and cooling the computers running the advanced AI software. The impact of data and energy scarcity is not certain; some analysts argue that although those factors exist, they need not constrain the technology’s continued advancement.4 This report focuses on the channels through which AI could affect the economy and the federal budget and does not assess the technology’s future trajectory or the tasks that it might ultimately be able to perform.\nPotential Effects of Artificial Intelligence on the Economy\nSome people believe that AI could become as pervasive as electricity and computing are today. Although large investments in AI are currently being made by major businesses in the technology sector, its use by businesses overall remains limited. For that reason, research on the technology’s economic effects is at an early stage, and the results from that research are uncertain. AI’s effect on the performance of individual businesses is not yet well understood. Even though economy-wide productivity gains from the technology are expected, the size of those gains varies across studies. The general effects of AI’s use on labor markets are also uncertain.\nProductivity and Economic Growth\nMany economists today view artificial intelligence as an emergent general-purpose technology. Such technologies do not have a sole definition, but they usually satisfy the following criteria:\n- They can be applied throughout the economy;\n- They are improved on a regular and sustained basis;\n- Their use is accompanied by innovations in related areas (for example, new products and services); and\n- They boost productivity and economic growth.\nAI could transform society in the same way that technological advances like the steam engine and electrification did in the distant past and as computing and the internet have done over the past few decades.5\nBusinesses’ current use of AI remains limited, though. Surveys show that only 5 percent of businesses of a broad range of sizes in the United States (accounting for 9 percent of employment) currently incorporate AI—in more than an incidental way—in their production of goods and services. Furthermore, those businesses that use AI tend to be found in particular industries: Businesses in the “information” and “professional, scientific, and technical services” industries are roughly twice as likely as other businesses to be using AI.6 Businesses’ adoption of AI is found to be more frequent when surveys do not require respondents to identify the technology’s use as being a significant part of the production process. For example, one survey found that about 28 percent of individuals reported using generative AI simply “for (their) job.”7\nResearch into the economic impact of AI, in terms of the productivity gains of businesses implementing it as well as the implications of those gains for the economy’s growth, is still relatively new. A common approach taken by researchers to study those effects has two steps. First, researchers identify tasks that AI is likely either to take over from workers altogether or to enable them to do better. Then, researchers convert those efficiency gains (or reductions in cost) to increases in the amount of a business’s output that can be produced per hour worked by the business’s employees—known as labor productivity. (Researchers sometimes use an alternative performance measure known as total factor productivity, which is the quantity of output produced relative to the amount of all inputs into production.)\nAlthough the research on AI’s economic effects focuses on labor, AI can make physical capital more productive as well. One example would be by enabling robots to grasp and manipulate workpieces that they have not encountered before. That type of change would improve efficiency because processes would no longer need to be programmed each time a workpiece changed shape or some other dimension. As a result, the cost of manufacturing disparate products could fall.\nAccording to research, businesses that implement AI can typically be expected to be more productive than those that do not. Some studies extrapolate from those impacts to estimate how much the economy’s output could rise if AI’s use became more widespread. (Such findings cannot directly be interpreted as having a similar effect on productivity in the economy as a whole. To be done properly, studies must take into account the interaction effects between, say, a new technology and other variables of interest, and their broader economic effects; such interactions are difficult to predict.) Although the impact of AI on the performance of individual businesses or of the economy overall is expected to be positive, the size of that impact varies greatly among studies.8\nThe conclusions of current studies about AI’s broad economic impact are preliminary. In those studies, actual outcomes are not observed. Instead, the studies attempt to link AI to specific tasks, tasks to workers, and workers affected by AI to changes in businesses’ performance. Surveys of businesses that are not currently using AI suggest that the eventual use of AI and its impact on workforces and performance remain poorly understood. For example, of the businesses that report that they do not use AI, four out of five state that “AI is not applicable to this business.”9\nExpense is a major obstacle to greater use of AI. Although leading AI systems have made great strides in performance in recent years, the cost of training them has increased—from tens of millions of dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars. Some analysts project AI training costs to reach $1 trillion by the end of the decade.10 Customizing a given model so that it can be applied by individual businesses can entail costs that make AI prohibitively expensive for many businesses, even if that customization involves relatively established and advanced types of AI, such as computer vision (which allows a computer to analyze and identify images).11\nNeither the lack of evidence to date that AI is substantially changing how goods and services are produced nor the fact that most businesses report that AI is not now advantageous to them means that the technology will not eventually have significant economic effects. For example, some researchers argue that AI will ultimately reach the stage of artificial general intelligence, at which point it will be able to carry out cognitive-based tasks as well as, or better than, human beings. If that occurred, the economic implications could be significant—in particular, for labor markets and the distribution of income.12\nIndeed, a substantial lag often follows the availability of important new technologies and their measurable impact on the economy. In the case of electrification, for example, four decades after the first central power station opened for business in the United States, only about half of the mechanical drive capacity in factories had been electrified.13 That said, in terms of technological diffusion, it is difficult to pinpoint where AI might be relative to such earlier timelines.\nEmployment and Wages\nResearch on the impact that AI has had on employment and wages is sparse. One survey found that roughly nine out of 10 businesses using AI report that they have not changed the number of workers they employ as a result and have no plans to do so. Among businesses that have made such changes or are planning to, employment increases are as likely to occur as decreases.14\nThe most accurate way to gauge AI’s likely impact on the workforce is by assessing how the technology will affect the tasks that workers perform. One recent study found that the eventual impact of AI—specifically, large language models—on workers’ jobs would vary: 80 percent of the U.S. workforce could have at least one-tenth of their tasks affected by AI, and 19 percent of workers could see at least half of their tasks affected.15\nThat potential scope of the use of AI makes it difficult to estimate how overall employment might change as a result of the technology and, in particular, how many workers might be displaced by it. Quantifying those effects would require establishing a threshold level of tasks for which AI is preferred over a worker and beyond which that worker would be deemed superfluous and have their job terminated. That threshold might not be the same for all businesses, because the increase in demand spurred by the decline in products’ prices brought on by AI-driven cost reductions could vary. In some cases, greater demand could lead to retaining—and potentially adding—workers who would perform fewer tasks at a higher volume of production; in other cases, any additional demand could be insufficient to warrant keeping on staff the employees most affected by AI.16\nThe technology’s effect on employees’ tasks can take the form of either substituting for workers in accomplishing a particular task or serving as a complement to them—that is, make them more productive. One task-based study argues that the substitution effect of AI will outweigh the complementarity effect; as a consequence, AI would reduce labor’s share of production.17\nOther research examines the substitution and complementarity effects of AI on workers of different skill levels. Those studies explore how the wage differential between low-skilled and high-skilled workers could change based on a business’s use of AI. If AI substituted for high-skilled workers, then the wage differential between the two groups of workers would decline; if it complemented high-skilled workers, the wage differential would rise. The opposite would be true for AI’s impact on low-skilled workers; in particular, if the technology complemented those workers, the wage differential would fall.18\nEvidence shows that generative AI can serve, at least to some degree, as a complement to low-skilled workers within a given occupation. By contrast, research on earlier forms of AI has found that the technology boosted the wages of some skilled workers.19 A study of generative AI’s impact on the productivity of customer support agents—measured by the number of issues resolved per hour—found that AI increased the productivity of entry-level and low-skilled agents by 34 percent. In contrast, experienced and highly skilled workers did not show significant gains in productivity. The authors suggest that “the AI model disseminates the best practices of more able workers and helps newer workers.”20 Other analysts argue that AI may be similarly skill-enhancing elsewhere, enabling workers who lack the experience or expertise of higher-paid employees to take on greater responsibility in the workplace and thus dampening earnings inequality among workers.21\nPotential Effects of Artificial Intelligence on the Federal Budget\nAI could affect the federal budget through two channels: its use in the economy, and its use by the government. Within each channel, AI could have an impact on revenues, mandatory spending, and spending subject to appropriation. Some budgetary effects might occur relatively quickly, whereas others might take longer to show up.\nThrough its use in the economy, AI could affect revenues by changing the amount of national income and its distribution. The technology could affect spending by altering participation in means-tested programs and the use of federally subsidized health care services, as well as by inducing more funding for federal programs that could support AI’s continued development and governance.\nThrough its use by the federal government, AI could affect both revenues and spending by increasing the efficiency of the government in collecting tax revenues and in distributing those revenues through transfer payments. AI also could enable improvements in the goods and services provided by the government, spurring federal programs to spend more to take advantage of the technology. Overall, the ultimate impact of AI on federal revenues and spending is uncertain.\nBudgetary Impact of AI’s Use in the Economy\nThe use of AI in the economy could affect revenues by changing the amount and distribution of income. In addition, it could affect mandatory spending, by changing participation in means-tested programs and the use of federally subsidized health care services, and spending subject to appropriation, by changing the policy choices that underlie funding decisions for various programs each year.\nRevenues. The amount of income and how that income is distributed could change as a result of AI’s use in the economy. An increase in income that affected businesses, investors, and workers proportionately would boost federal revenues. Because different categories of income are taxed at different rates, though, changes to the distribution of income among categories could offset that increase. Moreover, businesses’ taxable income could decline, at least temporarily, as a result of investments in AI.\nIf businesses became more productive, profits would eventually increase, pushing up earnings from capital, which accrue either to the owners of privately held businesses or to investors in publicly traded ones. As a result, tax payments on business income and returns from equities (in the form of dividend payments or capital gains) would rise. Those higher tax revenues could follow a period during which tax payments associated with AI fell because of tax deductions taken for investments in it and, potentially, because of lower profits during the initial (and typically costly) stage of implementing a new technology.\nThe effect of AI on taxable labor income is uncertain. It would depend on the extent to which the positive effects of a larger economy were offset by the potential negative effects that could occur if AI substituted for labor. Tax receipts tied to labor income could rise or fall depending on how the demand for workers shifted in response to the use of AI. If the use of AI was complementary to existing jobs (rather than a substitute for them), it could enable workers to do their current jobs better and perhaps undertake new tasks as well—making employees more productive and leading to higher wages. AI could also spur job creation if it enabled the production of new goods and services. Furthermore, if AI’s use led to income gains from higher wages and job creation, it could have a positive impact on federal receipts tied to labor income.22 In contrast, if workers were left permanently unemployed or were reallocated to lower-paying jobs by the technology, income and payroll taxes would decline.\nMandatory Spending. Participation in means-tested programs could rise or fall depending on the net effect that AI had on employment. Like revenues, mandatory spending programs—those whose spending is generally determined by formulas and eligibility criteria established by lawmakers rather than by annual appropriations—could also be affected by economic factors.\nFor example, even if the workers displaced by AI eventually found new jobs, that labor reallocation process could be lengthy. As a result, spending could increase over an extended period for federal income-support programs (including unemployment benefits, health care subsidies, and other means-tested programs), which provide cash payments or other assistance to people with relatively low income and few assets. But if AI increased economic output, employment, and wages, then mandatory spending on income-support programs could fall.\nChanges in mandatory spending could also occur as a result of the use of specific types of AI in the economy. For example, AI is currently being applied in pharmaceutical R&D.23 If patients’ consumption of the new drugs that AI helped discover were paid for by health insurance subsidized by the federal government, then federal outlays to provide pharmaceutical benefits could increase.\nThe provision of health care services is a notable example of the potential difficulty in distinguishing between AI’s use in the economy and its use by the federal government. That is because federal funding for activities that use AI can extend beyond the government to the private sector. For example, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) could fund AI-supported R&D that is carried out by staff in its own laboratories and by researchers elsewhere. In the former scenario, government employees would use AI, a clear-cut instance of use of the technology by the government. In the latter scenario, the technology could be used by, say, university faculty and affiliated researchers whose jobs were not dependent on federal financial support—even though some of the projects reliant on AI were contingent on receiving federal funds. A similar overlap applies to AI’s potential use in other types of health care that benefit from federal subsidies (see Box 1).\nSpending Subject to Appropriation. AI could affect spending for a variety of federal programs that require an appropriation by the Congress each year. For example, the reallocation of employment brought about by AI’s use in the economy might lead lawmakers to provide larger appropriations for educating and retraining displaced workers.\nThe use of AI in the economy could also influence funding for federal programs unrelated to employment. Businesses that produced AI systems might invest in R&D to advance the technology, for instance. If they were not able to appropriate all of the returns to that R&D, they would tend to invest less than the economically efficient level (that is, the level at which the financial payoff from additional R&D matched the investment in it). That underinvestment could be more likely to occur for AI because the technology is expected to foster innovation in many sectors of the economy, thus making the value of R&D for different users difficult to determine in advance. As a result, the Congress may supplement private-sector R&D efforts by increasing federal funding for research and development into AI.\nLawmakers have enacted legislation that addresses AI’s use both in the economy and by the federal government. Examples include the following:\n- The AI in Government Act of 2020 (Public Law 116-260), which created within the General Services Administration the AI Center of Excellence to facilitate adoption of AI by federal agencies;\n- The National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-283), which supports AI’s use in both the public and private sectors; and\n- Other laws, such as the Advancing American AI Act (P.L. 117-263), which focuses on monitoring and setting policies for AI’s use by the government.\nAs the technology is increasingly applied in the private sector, lawmakers might enact additional legislation that could affect federal spending. In particular, widespread use of AI might raise additional governance issues for the Congress and lead it to fund new or expanded federal agencies. One potential issue concerns data privacy. The most advanced AI systems rely on large quantities of data, which could result in improper use of personal information.\nBudgetary Impact of AI’s Use by the Federal Government\nThe federal government’s use of AI could affect both revenues and spending. The overall effect of AI on revenues collected by the tax system is ambiguous: Some factors will probably increase revenues, and others will decrease them. In terms of mandatory spending, AI could reduce the amount of payments made by the federal government, thus decreasing spending. But individuals’ use of AI could counteract the government’s efforts—if, for example, people used AI to forge identity documents that allowed them to fraudulently claim benefits. By enabling improvements in the quality of the goods and services that the government provides and the efficiency with which the government provides them, AI could lead to changes in mandatory spending and in the spending subject to appropriation of federal programs that sought to take advantage of the technology.\nRevenues. One way that AI could increase revenues is by improving the ability of the Internal Revenue Service to detect noncompliance by taxpayers and enforce laws intended to ensure compliance. The IRS is using AI to improve its estimates of the federal tax gap, which is the difference between the tax payments that individuals voluntarily make on a timely basis and the amount that they owe. Estimates of the tax gap are based on an analysis of audited tax returns that identifies noncompliance with the tax code missed by IRS auditors. The IRS expects that AI will enable examiners to identify noncompliance better.24 If the agency was able to use that information to increase compliance with tax laws, revenues would increase.\nAI could be used to reduce revenues as well. One way that might happen is if businesses and corporations used AI to reduce their tax liability. Some areas of tax law are particularly complex, and AI could be used to legally decrease tax payments by identifying aspects of the tax code that a person might miss.\nMandatory Spending. The government’s use of AI could have various effects on mandatory spending. One notable example concerns improper payments, which are payments that should not have been made or that were made in the incorrect amount. Those payments, which cost the government billions of dollars each year, can arise from incorrect and fraudulent billing in federal programs that pay private entities to provide services. By analyzing billing data and determining the characteristics of reimbursement claims that are likely to be incorrect or fraudulent, AI could help identify and reduce unwarranted federal payments and, as a result, lower spending. Efforts are already underway to apply AI to reduce improper payments in the Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security programs.25\nEstimates of improper payments vary substantially in scope, time period, and amount. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports that executive branch agencies’ cumulative estimates of the improper payments they made from 2003 to 2023 totaled about $2.7 trillion, or roughly $130 billion on an annual basis (not adjusted for inflation).26 Adopting a different methodology, which applies a statistical model to 12 federal agencies’ spending and is limited to estimating excessive payments solely from fraud, GAO found that federal losses from 2018 to 2022 totaled $233 billion to $521 billion—or about $47 billion to $104 billion annually over that five-year period—and that the range of losses was attributable both to uncertainty surrounding the estimates and to the different risk conditions prevailing over the period.27\nFor several reasons, it is unclear whether or how much the use of AI might eventually reduce the improper payments made by the federal government. Evidence about the technology’s effectiveness in the applications described above is lacking, and it is unclear how widely AI will eventually be deployed in those applications. (Studies of states’ use of the technology to establish eligibility for public assistance programs point to shortcomings in AI’s performance.)28 Furthermore, GAO suggests that although AI could be a useful tool for the federal government’s efforts to reduce fraud, the technology could also be used by individuals to perpetrate fraud. For example, AI could be used to create fake images for falsified documents.29\nAs noted earlier, the use of AI by federal employees carrying out R&D in health care could cause mandatory spending to rise if the outcome of that research, such as demand for new pharmaceuticals, received a federal subsidy. That increase could be offset by a decline in spending elsewhere if the new drugs eliminated the need for other types of federally subsidized health care.\nSpending Subject to Appropriation. For federal programs that make use of the technology, AI could affect their spending subject to appropriation. AI could, for example, be especially useful at the Department of Defense, an agency that relies heavily on information analysis.30 DoD has a large workforce—including members of the military, federal civilian workers, and private contractors—and many complex tasks that it must undertake to carry out its mission. DoD could use AI to manage its operations, enhancing the capability of current weapon systems and developing new ones. Effects on costs could be mixed: Increases in operational efficiency would tend to reduce costs; developing new weapon systems could either increase or decrease costs depending on how the cost of new systems compared with the cost of existing ones. And the AI systems themselves would require spending by the government. Less than 1 percent of DoD’s 2024 budget request is for AI.31\nFor other programs and agencies, AI could also have an impact on spending subject to appropriation. In particular, the increased labor productivity projected from AI’s use in the private sector could be realized for the federal workforce or federal contractors through efficiencies (and cost reductions) in how the federal government operates or delivers services. One example is AI’s support for, and potential replacement of, staff in the call centers of programs operated by the General Services Administration, Internal Revenue Service, and Department of State.\nAlthough investments in AI might initially increase agencies’ spending, costs could eventually decline. The size of any decrease would depend on how many efficiencies were realized. For example, if AI substituted for labor, it could reduce staffing requirements.\nOther Considerations About Budgetary Effects\nMany aspects of AI’s adoption, use, and effects are uncertain. In assessing the ways that AI could affect federal revenues and spending, several considerations should be kept in mind.\nFirst, the examples in this report are illustrative. Whether describing projects that are underway or suggesting projects that are possible, the examples this report provides are intended simply to illustrate the various ways that the technology could affect federal revenues or spending. The federal government may currently, and in the future, use AI in many more ways than the applications listed above, but the extent of the technology’s eventual adoption and use are uncertain.32\nSecond, outlays for AI could take the place of other federal spending. For statistical analysis, for example, AI could replace software that the government has been using and would continue to rely on if AI was not available. Use of AI might also entail greater reliance on cloud computing, which could take the place of upgrades to agencies’ computer hardware. In that case, determining the true budgetary cost of AI would require netting out the previous federal spending that was done to pay for licenses and other costs associated with using the abandoned software and hardware.\nThird, the impact of AI’s use could manifest in different ways over time, and those ways could have countervailing effects on the federal budget. If AI improved the quality of federally subsidized pharmaceuticals and health care more broadly, it could enable individuals to live longer, healthier lives. That development could increase revenues (because more taxes would be paid over a longer period) as well as spending (because benefits would be provided through Social Security, Medicare, and other programs for more years) in relation to the amounts that would otherwise have been received and spent.33\nThe budgetary effects would also depend on whether federal agencies made effective decisions about adopting AI systems. For example, AI models could be expensive to acquire, train, and operate. At a minimum, those costs would cover buying the software, paying employees to maintain and operate the AI models, and purchasing the electricity needed to run them; costs would probably vary by application and by agency. For AI systems to either increase revenues or reduce spending, those positive budgetary impacts would need to outweigh the negative effects of the outlays required to obtain and implement the technology.\nFourth, AI could have impacts that would not be fully reflected in federal budget totals. For government spending on pharmaceutical R&D, for instance, AI could enable innovations of higher quality than would have been possible otherwise. Consequently, even if new drugs developed with AI were more expensive, they may deliver more benefits to patients per dollar of R&D spending than would have been possible without the technology. In such cases—which could also arise from other, nonpharmaceutical applications of AI, such as increased security through a more robust national defense—the payoff from greater cost-effectiveness would not necessarily be captured, or at least identifiable, in data about federal revenues or spending.\n1.

Barr\nAt the ReykjavÃk Economic Conference 2025, Central Bank of Iceland, ReykjavÃk, Iceland\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.1 In my remarks, I would like to address a key question facing economists, policymakers, and people all over the world: How will artificial intelligence, particularly generative artificial intelligence, or GenAI, affect workers and the labor market in the years ahead?\nBefore I turn to that issue, I'd like to touch on a topic that I expect is also of interest: the outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy.\nThe U.S. economy entered this quarter in a relatively strong position: The unemployment rate has been low and stable, and the disinflationary process has continued on a gradual, albeit uneven, path towards our 2 percent objective. Private domestic final purchases have been solid. Overall, the economy has been resilient.\nAgainst that backdrop, the outlook has been clouded by trade policies that have led to an increase in uncertainty, contributing to declines in measures of consumer and business sentiment. I expect tariffs to lead to higher inflation in the United States and lower growth both in the United States and abroad starting later this year.\nIn my view, higher tariffs could lead to disruption to global supply chains and create persistent upward pressure on inflation. Faced with substantial tariffs, businesses will likely change how they source intermediate inputs, and it will take time and investment for them to reroute their distribution networks. Conversely, global trade networks may change rapidly, and some suppliers may not be able to adapt quickly enough to survive these changes. This concern is particularly acute for small businesses, which are less diversified, less able to access credit, and hence more vulnerable to adverse shocks. Small businesses play a vital role in production networks, often providing specialized inputs that can't easily be sourced elsewhere, and business failures could further disrupt supply chains. As we saw during the pandemic, such disruptions can have large and lasting effects on prices, as well as output.\nI am equally concerned that tariffs will lead to higher unemployment as the economy slows. Thus, the FOMC may be in a difficult position if we were to see both rising inflation and rising unemployment.\nThe size and scope of the recent tariff increases are without modern precedent, we don't know their final form, and it is too soon to know how they will affect the economy. Yet given the economy's strong starting point and the progress we have made in bringing inflation back toward our 2 percent objective, monetary policy is in a good position to adjust as conditions unfold. Meanwhile, we will also be closely monitoring how technologies like artificial intelligence are being integrated into economic activity and analyzing the implications for how the economy will evolve.\nLet me now return to the longer-term question of how AI will affect the labor market. Debate about machines replacing workers is nothing new, and even artificial intelligence is not particularly new either. AI has, in some form, arguably been around for decades. Computer scientists have been developing machine learning algorithms for many years, and these algorithms have been widely used in commercial applications, such as fraud detection and advertising. Speech and facial recognition are already ubiquitous. These more long-standing forms of AI are continuing to improve, driving progress in domains ranging from finance to medical diagnosis, and becoming so deeply embedded in our daily lives that we scarcely notice them anymore.\nBut GenAI promises to go much further. Unlike traditional machine learning techniques, which often focus on relatively simple prediction and classification tasks, the large language models that have emerged in recent years can generate new contentâanything from news articles to computer code to images and video to customer service dialogue. Emerging forms of \"agentic\" AI can undertake complex, multistep tasksâfor example, taking a customer through a transaction and then placing an automated order. As AI continues to develop, it will increasingly be combined with physical technologies like autonomous vehicles and advanced robotics, further extending its ability to interact with the real world. And AI may be shaping up to become what the esteemed economist Zvi Griliches called an \"invention of a method of inventing\" that speeds up the research and development process itself.2\nGrowing evidence indicates that AI will be a \"general purpose technology\"âsuch as railroads, electricity, or computersâwhich is characterized by widespread adoption, complementary progress in many downstream applications, and ongoing improvement in the core technology.3 Past general purpose technologies have dramatically improved productivity. So, against this background, the natural question is, what about AI?\nIn trying to understand how AI might transform work, it's useful to consider how it could be applied in individual occupations, each of which comprises a range of tasks that vary in their susceptibility to automation. Like past waves of information technology, AI will substitute for human labor in some tasks, complement human labor in other tasks, and spur the creation of new tasks that humans will perform, at least initially.4 The net effects of AI on employment, both in the aggregate and across demographic and education groups, will depend on the relative size of these offsetting effects.\nA pessimistic view is that AI and robotics could become so capable and cost effective as to render most human labor obsolete, culminating in mass unemployment. Such concerns about technological advances are hardly a novel development. At least since the Luddites of the early 19th century tried to disable textile looms, people have feared that machines would bring about steep declines in employment, wages, and human welfare.5\nEconomists have long been skeptical of that view, which suffers from the \"lump of labor fallacy\"âthe presumption that there's a fixed amount of work to be done, so if machines do it, humans will not.6 New technologies do eliminate some existing occupations, and not all workers benefit from technological change. But technology also creates new occupations, and the many waves of technological advances over the centuries haven't rendered humans obsolete. For example, many of the tasks that were performed by humans in the 1950s are now performed by computers and robots, and yet the unemployment rate is similar to what it was back then, while the labor force participation rate is higher overall.\nHowever, the amazing potential capabilities and breadth of applications associated with AIâmany of which are already apparentâmake it worth asking whether this time may be different. AI holds enormous promise of faster economic growth, advances in human health, and a higher standard of living. But alongside the kinds of labor market disruptions seen in past episodes of revolutionary technological change, we will need to consider the possibility of more sweeping changes in the way we work.\nA Scenario Approach\nIn a previous speech, I outlined two hypothetical scenarios describing how AI could evolve.7 In the first scenario, we see only incremental adoption that primarily augments what humans do today but still leads to significant and widespread productivity gains. In the second scenario, we see profound change, in which we extend human capabilities with far-reaching consequences.\nToday, I will apply the same approach to analyze the potential effects of AI on the labor market. Of course, there is tremendous uncertainty about how AI will evolve and how it will affect the economy, as well as society more broadly. Amid this uncertainty, a scenario-based approach can give us a framework for thinking about the potential effects of AI on employment, real wages, and productivity, as well as for considering the possible role that government could play in influencing this transition.\nScenario 1: Incremental Progress\nLet's start with the \"gradual\" scenario, in which new AI technologies are adopted at a brisk, but not a breathless, pace or advance quickly at first and then plateauâperhaps because of constraints imposed by computing resources, the exhaustion of novel training data, and rising energy consumption.\nUnder this scenario, AI primarily operates by automating someâbut not allâtasks within many occupations. We've seen some of this task substitution happen already: Computer programmers rely on AI copilots to write code, allowing them to focus on higher-level tasks, while customer support agents can use chatbots to improve and expedite their responses.8 Lawyers draw on GenAI to conduct legal research, while AI-powered safety features improve the performance of human automobile drivers.\nUnder this scenario, as foundational models improve, novel use cases are discovered, and businesses continue to integrate AI into their operations, more and more occupations will be affected, and many jobs will use AI tools more intensively. As these technologies improve, even incremental change may allow AI to become accurate and cheap enough to replace some occupations altogether. It's hard to make predictions at this stage. But a plausible conjecture is that we could see, for example, fewer human programmers, lawyers, or commercial drivers. At the same time, most current occupations would persist in this scenarioâalbeit in modified and more productive forms.\nBeyond existing occupations, general purpose technologies also encourage the creation of new occupations, fueled by new products and novel ways of doing business. It's difficult to envision the novel jobs that will replace the ones we might lose to an incremental AI scenario. But one possibility is that the future could bring us managers of AI agents, specialists in humanâAI collaboration, ethicists, safety experts, and large numbers of people involved in adopting, maintaining, and educating about AI tools. Technology, and how we use a particular innovation, evolves in unpredictable ways, and we should expect to be surprised.\nUnder this scenario, jobs remain plentiful, real wages are buoyed by productivity gains, and employment and labor force participation remain high and could even rise, if strong wage growth entices new labor market entrants and if improvements in health care increase work capacity among older or disabled individuals. If the widespread adoption of AI proceeds gradually, then workers will have time to adjust, reducing the disruption to the labor marketâthough, as with previous general purpose technologies, AI would likely imply that some groups of workers experience a painful process of dislocation and transition.\nRetraining could help here. A recent survey carried out by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that many businesses plan to retrain their workers to use AI rather than laying them off.9 In some cases, AI may disrupt career ladders by automating many entry-level tasksâsuch as reviewing legal documents or drafting codeâthat were historically performed by early-career workers. But if labor demand changes slowly enough, students and workers are more likely to have time to predict which skills will be marketable and to make and recoup human capital investments before their skills become obsolete.\nWhat about the effect of AI on inequality? Some research suggests that GenAI may help less-productive workers catch up to their more-productive peers.10 That said, the AI economy will likely put a premium on digital skills, facility with new technologies, and adaptability. The precedent of the computer revolution suggests that highly educated workers may benefit most, boosting wage inequalityâa phenomenon called \"skill-biased technological change.\"11 Another possibility is that the labor share of income could decline, if capital owners benefit more than wage earnersâfor example, because the gains accruing from AI adoption go to large, highly capitalized firms whose technical capabilities, consumer networks, and training data allow them to develop state-of-the-art AI techniques.\nScenario 2: Transformation\nNow let's consider an alternative scenario in which AI completely transforms the economy. As I described in my earlier speech, in this transformative scenario, humans employ AI to unleash their imagination and creativityâcombined with robust investment in research and developmentâto make rapid breakthroughs that have the potential to improve our lives. With growth propelled by swift technological progress, society's resources would be vastly expanded, AI would spur revolutionary advances in health, and many individuals would enjoy more time for leisure activities.\nIndeed, transformative AI could bring about a state of affairs that John Maynard Keynes famously envisioned almost a hundred years ago, one in which there are \"ever larger and larger classes and groups of people from whom problems of economic necessity have been practically removed.\"12 At the same time, transformative AI could imply a much smaller role for human laborâa development that would entail sweeping social changes and profound challenges for government.\nUnder this scenario, AI would take over a broad range of existing jobs. As economist Anton Korinek writes, \"AI systems advance toward mastering all forms of cognitive work that can be performed by humans, including new tasks that don't even exist yet.\"13 Building on developments we are already starting to see, improved chatbots and AI agents would outperform their human counterparts in activities ranging from customer support to medical diagnosis. Along similar lines, advanced robotics could increasingly substitute for human workers in manual and production jobs. Widespread automation would bring many benefits. The availability and quality of many services could increase markedly, and many less-desirable jobsâsuch as those involving tedious tasks or dangerous working conditionsâcould be transferred to machines.\nWhat jobs would exist in this more transformative scenario? As in the more gradual scenarioâand just as has happened in the past, when earlier general purpose technologies were adoptedâwe would see the emergence of new occupations. These would notably include jobs that involve managing the new AI-dominated economy. In addition, some existing occupations would likely persist, at least for some time. This would be the case for three key reasons. First, some jobs may prove especially hard to automate. For example, plumbers and mechanics rely on physical dexterity and adaptability to situationsâattributes that machines may find difficult to replicate, or to replicate cheaply. Second, in some contexts, consumers may insist on a human touch. Patients may still want human doctors and therapists, while parents may want human teachers and caregivers to look after their children. Third, even when AI has the technical capability to carry out tasks, some jobs are likely to be protected by laws and regulations. For example, legal and political systems would likely continue to insist on human judges and elected officials. Eventually, however, an increasing share of current jobs may be automated. The technological frontier is moving quickly, consumers' preferences may change as they become more comfortable interacting with AI, and the regulatory landscape could evolve to provide broader roles for AI.\nIt's difficult to say how many jobs will exist under transformative AI. On the one hand, it's possible thatâas has happened so often in the pastâthe economy will find inventive new ways to keep most people employed. On the other hand, there are concerns that some workers could experience a large enough decline in their earnings potential that paid work may no longer be an available option. Employment and labor force participation could fall; displaced workers may grapple with a loss of daily routines, social connectedness, and the meaning they derived from employment. The risk of a significant decline in employment looms large in many people's concerns about AI, and it's important for policymakers to be attentive to that risk.\nEven if AI ultimately creates as many jobs as it eliminates, we should expect that the transition will be difficult. Existing firms would likely reorganize their production, laying off workers in the process. They could also lose market share to technologically sophisticated start-ups, which could scale up with a minimal number of human workers managing AI subordinates.14 Many displaced workers would have obsolete skills, and skill mismatch could lead to a structural increase in unemployment as these workers retool for new occupations. It is possible that unemployment might rise only temporarily. It is also possible, however, that more sustained increases could be observed. That would be the case if technology continued to evolve too quickly for many workers to keep up, leading to continual churn and ongoing dislocation.\nHow might transformative AI affect income inequality? Both traditionally high-wage occupations, such as lawyers and financial professionals, and lower-wage occupations, such as factory and retail workers, could be automated, and it is difficult to predict how AI would affect wage structures. But the largest wage gains would likely go to the highest-skilled workers, as they would be best positioned to implement frontier technologies and help oversee the AI economy. In addition, if capital owners are the main beneficiaries, the labor share of income could decline precipitously.\nTransformative AI could bring about profound improvements in living standards, leisure opportunities, and human health. At the same time, society would confront profound distributional changes and potential challenges. Much would depend on how broadly the economic benefits are shared, how policymakers respond, and how society adapts to the rapid pace of change.\nHow Will We Know Which Future We Are Living in?\nThe world looks very different across these two scenarios. As AI spreads throughout the economy, how will we know which world we're living in, particularly in view of the likelihood that AI adoption will proceed at different rates in different occupations and industries?\nFirst, we will need to track how many businesses are using AI and how it is affecting their operations. Recent surveys give different impressions about AI adoption thus far, but they consistently show rapid increases in usage over time.15\nSecond, we will need to monitor AI's evolving technological capabilities. AI developers test their models against human performance in benchmark activities like standardized tests and visual tasks. Results of these tests will continue to provide important clues about which activities, and thus which occupations, are at risk of being automated. Along these lines, economists have already developed measures of occupations' exposure to automation. They have based these measures on the characteristics of the tasks involved in different occupations.16 Of course, as the set of tasks that AI can perform expands, these measures can be updated accordingly.\nA third way to judge how AI is changing the economy is that data on job openings will likely be a leading indicator of changes in labor demand. What kinds of jobs are employers creating? What skills do they cite in job ads?17\nAnd, lastly, job growth by occupation and industry is likely to reflect the emerging effects of AI. So far, the imprint of AI is difficult to discern in the employment statistics, but that is likely to change. It may be difficult to disentangle the effects of AI from the other determinants of employment growth, especially in real time. But in the event of truly sweeping changes in the occupational structure, the effects of AI should show up in the data.\nLooking Ahead\nWhat do these two scenarios imply for society? In scenario 1, the issues that society has to address will be more straightforward. Policymakers will have to decide how to regulate emergent technologies, education and training programs will have to be tailored to shifts in labor demand, and some labor market regulations may need to be updated. In scenario 2, the issues that society will need to address will be more profound. Questions will include how to ensure that the economic gains associated with AI are broadly shared across individuals and households, and how to adapt social institutions to a world in which many more individuals in their prime working years may be working less. Fortunately, although this second scenario would entail many difficult challenges, it also implies a world in which society has many more resources to deploy against those challenges.\nThose are some of the big questions that society may need to grapple with in the future, and most of these questions are not those that will be primarily addressed by monetary policymakers. As a central banker, I can speak more specifically about how structural changes in the economy related to AI could affect monetary policy considerationsâin particular, the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Monetary policy considerations could be affected in many ways; I will limit myself to two prominent possibilities.\nFirst, AI may require monetary policymakers to reassess our estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, which informs our assessment of the cyclical state of the economy and thus the appropriate stance of monetary policy. The natural rate, which we call u*, is the unemployment rate that corresponds to the maximum level of employment that can be maintained without producing undesirably high inflation. Among other things, u* depends on the efficiency with which matches are formed between workers and firms, and it could rise if shifts in labor demand across industries and occupations lead to skill mismatch and lengthy unemployment spells as workers retrain and switch careers. The natural rate also depends on the demographic composition of the labor force, which AI could affect. If AI shifts the workforce toward groups that have higher labor force attachment but lower unemployment rates (such as college graduates), the result could be downward pressure on u*. It should be stressed that u* is never directly observed and is difficult to discern in real time. But economists use a wide range of models to estimate the natural rate, and we can use those models to see how u* is changing as AI is adopted more widely.18\nAnother related consideration relevant for monetary policy is how economic changes due to AI will affect the neutral interest rate, or r*, which is the level of the real interest rate consistent with the economy being at its potential and inflation being at our 2 percent objective. Economic theory suggests that a permanently higher growth rate of productivity, of the kind that might arise under either AI scenario, tends to raise r*. When that happens, a higher real interest rate would be required to deliver any desired monetary policy stance. A challenge that we face is that it is difficult to work out in real time how r* is evolving. But we can make judgments about developments in the behavior of r* by monitoring the relationship between economic activity and interest rates and by using financial market information to estimate longer-run real interest rates.\nConclusion\nI'll return to the broader point and conclude. AI is poised to transform our economy, likely in profound ways. But the speed and extent of that transformation are not yet clear. AI is likely to boost productivity, increase scientific discovery, and transform the nature of work. How these developments unfold will have important implications for society and for central bankers.\n1.

    "summary": "[Published: May 9, 2025] Governor Michael S. Barr of the Federal Reserve discusses the potential impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on the labor market, emphasizing uncertainty around how AI will affect workers and employment patterns in the coming years. He highlights that while the U.S. economy remains strong with low and stable unemployment and gradual disinflation, trade policies introducing tariffs could disrupt supply chains, increase inflation, and reduce growth—factors that may interact with AI-driven economic shifts. The Federal Reserve is monitoring how these forces might collectively influence labor markets and monetary policy.\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System | https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250509a.htm\n\n[Published: Dec 2024] The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) outlines how artificial intelligence—particularly its ability to perform human-like cognitive tasks, identify patterns, and respond to complex queries—could transform the economy by increasing efficiency, enabling new products, and altering labor demand. While AI may boost economic growth, its effects on employment, wages, income distribution, and federal budget outcomes remain uncertain in timing, direction, and magnitude. The report notes that only 5% of U.S. businesses currently use AI for production due to high customization costs and unclear cost-benefit timelines. Potential impacts include both rapid and long-term changes to the economy and public finances.\n\nCongressional Budget Office | https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61147",
