- [ ] Fix Voice recognition
- [ ] Research: What is Geospatial Searching?
- [ ] Implement: Speaker Recognition
- [ ] Personal: Fortnite Refund  
- [ ] Work on Ollie-Tech
- [ ] Test Synth pipeline

- [ ] Knowledge Distillation Automation  
   # Continuous background process converting complex patterns into efficient representations while preserving functionality

- [ ] Information Elicitation  
   # Techniques for gathering missing information:
   - [ ] Progressive questioning based on knowledge gaps
   - [ ] Clarification requests for ambiguous instructions  
   - [ ] Preference elicitation for decision support

- [ ] Topic Steering  
   # Methods for productive conversations:
   - [ ] Introducing relevant subtopics
   - [ ] Refocusing wandering discussions
   - [ ] Maintaining engagement through transitions

- [ ] Context Fusion Engine  
   # Integrates multimodal inputs (visual/audio/schedule/location) for comprehensive situational awareness

- [ ] Speaker Diarization  
   # Identifying and tracking individual speakers in multi-speaker conversations

## Vision System Roadmap

- [ ] Temporal & Contextual Memory
- [ ] Dynamic Object Tracking  
  # Maintain JSON state of key objects across frames  
  Example state:  
    ```json
    {
        "cup_on_table": {"state": "upright", "last_seen": "2024-07-29T10:00:05Z"},
        "door": {"state": "closed", "last_seen": "2024-07-29T10:00:05Z"}
    }
    ```

- [ ] Change Summaries  
  # Generate concise human-readable descriptions of scene changes  
  Example: "The cup was knocked over and door is now open"

- [ ] Historical Context  
  # Maintain rolling window of last 5-10 descriptions for richer context

### Tier 3: Proactive Vision
- [ ] Gaze-Informed Assistance  
  # Use gaze coordinates to identify focused objects and suggest actions  
  Example: "That's the Breville Barista Express. Need cleaning instructions?"

- [ ] Anomaly Detection  
  # Compare current scene against learned baseline of "normal"  
  Prompt: "Given normal state `[summary]`, identify any anomalies"

- [ ] Visual Question Answering  
  # Immediate frame capture + processing for visual queries  
  Example: "What's the wifi password on that sign?" â†’ OCR extraction

Notes:
Concise prompts do not help, verbosity and in depth directions are key
