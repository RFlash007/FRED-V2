## Novel UI Ideas Brainstorm

Building on the futuristic, mind-map-inspired interface:

**1. Interactive Background Mind Map:**
   - **Live Topic Clustering:** Background visualization dynamically clusters nodes related to current conversation topics. New concepts branch out visually.
   - **Node Interaction:** Clicking/hovering on background map nodes highlights related messages or displays concept metadata (tooltip/panel).
   - **"Memory Trace" Animation:** Animate connections between relevant background nodes during memory access, showing Fred's "thought path".

**2. Context-Aware Sidebar:**
   - **Dynamic Panels:** Sidebar dynamically shows panels relevant to the current context (e.g., "Code Analysis" panel when discussing code).
   - **Visual Memory Links:** Visually connect related information within sidebar panels (e.g., lines between episodic memories and related semantic concepts).
   - **"Focus" Indicator:** Small, glowing indicator highlights the configuration or memory type Fred is currently prioritizing.

**3. Evolving Message Bubbles:**
   - **Connection Anchors:** Add visual anchors to message bubbles; draw temporary animated lines between related messages.
   - **Inline Entity Highlighting:** Automatically detect and subtly highlight key entities in Fred's responses. Clicking could bring up related info.
   - **"Thought Stream" Input:** Show a faint, dynamic stream of abstract shapes/keywords near the message bubble while Fred generates a response, replacing static loading indicators.

**4. Command Palette / Universal Search:**
   - Implement a quick-access command palette (e.g., Ctrl+K) for fuzzy searching through chat history, memories, config, and actions, using the futuristic aesthetic.

**5. Audio-Visual Feedback (Optional):**
   - Subtle, non-intrusive sound effects for key actions (message send/receive, mode change, memory access) paired with brief visual pulses.
