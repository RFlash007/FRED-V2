Part I: De-efferented AI poses no threat; threats源自 connected systems (nukes, biotech). Existing human-controlled systems already create risks; AI adds to these, with risk decreasing as more humans can collapse civilization. Part II: Biotech ranks high due to human capability to engineer pandemic microbes. Savant software, not general AI, drives this risk, making it more imminent than superintelligence. Conclusion: Prioritize peripheral systems and savant software; superintelligence concerns are secondary.  \nReferences & Citations  \nBibliographic Tools  \nConnected Papers  \nLitmaps  \nscite Smart Citations  \nCode/Data/Media  \nalphaXiv  \nCatalyzeX  \nDagsHub  \nGotit.pub  \nHugging Face  \nPapers with Code  \nScienceCast  \nDemos  \nRecommenders  \nInfluence Flower  \nCORE  \narXivLabs: Open, community-driven projects.
