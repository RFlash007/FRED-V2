Methodology: Utilized official records, congressional archives, and reputable news sources to verify information. Core Findings: No bills were passed by Congress and signed by Donald Trump in July 2025. Analysis: The absence of legislative activity aligns with the fact that Trump's presidential term ended on January 20, 2021, making it impossible for him to sign any bills in 2025. Conclusions: There were no bills passed by Congress and signed by Donald Trump in July 2025 due to his non-presidency at that time. Sources: Official White House records, Congressional archives, and reputable news outlets.",
