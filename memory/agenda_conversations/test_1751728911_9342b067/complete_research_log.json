Extensive verification efforts found no evidence of such a bill being passed. The closest related policies involve executive actions on deregulation and tax reforms, but these lack specific bill numbers or formal legislative texts. Expert analyses from 2024-2025 indicate no major new legislation directly attributed to Trump post-2024 election. The absence of documentation suggests either misinformation about the bill's existence or potential confusion with other policies.",
