1. Episodic Memory Buffer: A compressed representation of experiences that serve as scaffolding for future learning without requiring explicit rehearsal

2. Progressive Compression: Infrequently accessed knowledge is automatically compressed using task-specific lossy compression algorithms that preserve functional capabilities while reducing storage requirements.

3. Knowledge Distillation Automation: A continuous background process distills complex learned patterns into more efficient representations that require less computational resources while preserving functional capabilities.

4. Unsupervised Domain Discovery: Automatically identifying conceptual domains in incoming information without explicit task labels.

5. Context-Conditioned Persona Mapping: Rather than having a single output generation strategy, F.R.E.D. dynamically maps its core personality traits to contextually appropriate expressions.

6. Information Elicitation: Techniques for gathering missing information through:

- Progressive questioning based on knowledge gaps
- Clarification requests for ambiguous instructions
- Preference elicitation for decision support

7. Topic Steering: Methods to direct conversations toward productive outcomes:

- Introducing relevant subtopics at appropriate moments
- Refocusing wandering discussions toward original goals
- Transitioning between related topics to maintain engagement

8. Context Fusion Engine: Integrates multimodal inputs (visual, audio, schedule, location) to establish comprehensive situational awareness 

9. Speaker Diarization: Identifying and tracking individual speakers in multi-speaker conversations.

10. Token Context window optimization techniques
