                    F.R.E.D. V2 WEB SEARCH SYSTEM
                  Complete Vision & Implementation Guide
===============================================================================

Date Created: August 1, 2025
System Version: F.R.E.D. V2 Post-Refactor
Implementation Status: COMPLETE

===============================================================================
                              ORIGINAL VISION
===============================================================================

The goal was to completely overhaul F.R.E.D.'s web search capabilities by:

1. SIMPLIFYING the complex, overlapping web search functions in Tools.py
2. CREATING a modular, professional-grade system with clear separation of concerns
3. REPLACING the legacy Scout agent system with intelligent Gate-based routing
4. IMPLEMENTING robust spam filtering and content quality assessment
5. INTEGRATING everything seamlessly with F.R.E.D.'s existing architecture

The vision was NOT to build something completely new, but to refactor and 
clarify what existed while adding intelligent routing and better quality control.

===============================================================================
                            SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
===============================================================================

The new web search system follows a layered, modular architecture:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                              USER QUERY                                 │

===============================================================================
                              CORE COMPONENTS
===============================================================================

1. GATE ANALYSIS & ROUTING (memory/gate.py)
------------------------------------------

PURPOSE: The "traffic controller" that decides what type of search is needed.

HOW IT WORKS:
- User sends a query to F.R.E.D.
- Gate analyzes the query using an LLM (GATE_OLLAMA_MODEL)
- LLM returns JSON with routing flags, including "web_search_strategy"
- web_search_strategy contains:
  * needed: boolean (does this query need web search?)
  * search_priority: "quick" or "thorough"
  * search_query: optimized search terms extracted from user message

DECISION LOGIC:
- If search_priority = "quick" → Route to intelligent_search()
- If search_priority = "thorough" → Route to A.R.C.H./D.E.L.V.E. queue
- If no search needed → Continue to normal F.R.E.D. agent processing

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE
- Added web search routing logic to run_gate_analysis()
- Created _handle_quick_search() and _handle_thorough_search() functions
- Updated Gate system prompts to use new web_search_strategy structure


2. CORE WEB SEARCH FUNCTIONS (web_search_core.py)
------------------------------------------------

This is the heart of the modular system - three focused functions:

A) gather_links(query, max_results=5)
   PURPOSE: Get the best search result links with spam filtering
   
   HOW IT WORKS:
   - Tries Brave Search API first (primary)
   - Falls back to SearchAPI if Brave fails
   - Deduplicates URLs using set tracking
   - Filters out spam/ad domains and URL patterns
   - Returns exactly 5 high-quality links with titles and descriptions
   
   SPAM FILTERING:
   - Domain blacklist: Pinterest, Facebook, shopping sites, etc.
   - URL pattern filtering: /buy-now/, /affiliate/, /discount/, etc.
   - Automatically skips spam links and tries next results

B) extract_page_content(url)
   PURPOSE: Robustly extract clean, readable content from webpages
   
   HOW IT WORKS:
   - Uses Trafilatura library for content extraction
   - Extracts metadata: title, description, publish_date, author
   - Applies content-based spam filtering
   - Returns structured dictionary or None if extraction fails
   
   CONTENT FILTERING:
   - Checks for promotional language in titles
   - Validates minimum content length (200+ characters)
   - Detects excessive promotional keywords
   - Filters out pure advertisement pages

C) intelligent_search(query, search_priority, mode)
   PURPOSE: LLM-orchestrated search with flexible output modes
   
   HOW IT WORKS:
   - Gathers initial links using gather_links()
   - Uses LLM to analyze and select the 3 best links
   - Extracts content from selected URLs
   - Sends results to GIST for summarization
   - Returns comprehensive search results with summary
   
   MODES:
   - "links_only": Just return the search result links
   - "auto": Full pipeline with content extraction and summary
   - "deep": Extended search with more thorough analysis

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE
- All three functions implemented with robust error handling
- Spam filtering system operational
- LLM integration working with JSON format
- Embedding-based relevance scoring implemented


3. GIST SUMMARIZATION SYSTEM (prompts.py)
----------------------------------------

PURPOSE: Transform raw web search results into clean, organized summaries

ORIGINAL SYSTEM: GIST was a webpage "sanitizer" that removed junk content
NEW SYSTEM: GIST is now a "web search synthesizer" that organizes findings

HOW IT WORKS:
- Receives search query + extracted web content
- Filters content for relevance to the query
- Organizes findings by source URL
- Preserves important quotes, data, and facts exactly as written
- Removes irrelevant content but includes anything possibly connected

OUTPUT FORMAT:
(Relevant content from site 1 - key facts, quotes, data points)
Site 1 URL

(Relevant content from site 2 - key facts, quotes, data points)  
Site 2 URL

This format makes it easy for F.R.E.D. to understand which information 
came from which source for better context and citation.

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE
- GIST system prompt completely rewritten
- New user prompt format supports query + search results input
- URL-grouped output format implemented


4. A.R.C.H./D.E.L.V.E. INTEGRATION (memory/arch_delve_research.py)
----------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE: Handle "thorough" search requests that need deep research

EXISTING SYSTEM: A.R.C.H./D.E.L.V.E. was already a sophisticated research 
pipeline with multiple AI agents working together iteratively.

NEW INTEGRATION: 
- Gate can now route complex queries to this system
- Creates research tasks like "Conduct comprehensive web research on: [query]"
- Uses the full A.R.C.H./D.E.L.V.E./V.E.T./S.A.G.E. pipeline
- Returns comprehensive research reports with citations

HOW THE INTEGRATION WORKS:
- _handle_thorough_search() generates unique task ID
- Calls enhanced_conduct_iterative_research_with_quality()
- Returns full research findings to the user

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE
- Integration functions implemented in Gate
- Thorough search routing operational
- Fallback to quick search if thorough search fails


5. SPAM & AD FILTERING SYSTEM
---------------------------

PURPOSE: Prevent low-quality, promotional, and irrelevant content

MULTI-LAYER APPROACH:

Layer 1: Domain Blacklist
- Blocks known low-quality domains (Pinterest, social media, shopping sites)
- Applied during link gathering phase
- Fast, efficient filtering

Layer 2: URL Pattern Filtering  
- Blocks promotional URL patterns (/buy-now/, /affiliate/, /discount/)
- Regex-based pattern matching
- Catches promotional pages even on legitimate domains

Layer 3: Content-Based Filtering
- Applied only to pages that are actually extracted
- Checks title and content for promotional language
- Validates content length and quality
- More sophisticated but only used when needed

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE
- All three layers implemented and operational
- Comprehensive spam domain list created
- URL pattern filtering with 10+ promotional patterns
- Content quality assessment algorithms active


6. EMBEDDING-BASED RELEVANCE SCORING
----------------------------------

PURPOSE: Rank search results by semantic similarity rather than keyword matching

HOW IT WORKS:
- calculate_relevance_score(query, title) function
- Gets embeddings for both search query and page title
- Calculates cosine similarity between the vectors
- Returns relevance score from 0.0 to 1.0

ADVANTAGES:
- Understands semantic meaning, not just keyword presence
- Can match related concepts even with different terminology
- More robust than simple keyword counting

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE
- Function implemented using Ollama embeddings
- Uses configured EMBED_MODEL from config.py
- Numpy-based cosine similarity calculation

===============================================================================
                              LEGACY CLEANUP
===============================================================================

SCOUT AGENT SYSTEM - COMPLETELY REMOVED
--------------------------------------

WHAT IT WAS:
- Scout was a lightweight web search agent
- Performed quick searches with confidence assessment
- Had its own prompts, configuration, and dispatch logic
- Overlapped significantly with the new modular system

WHAT WAS REMOVED:
- agents/scout.py (110 lines deleted entirely)
- Scout model configuration from config.py
- Scout agent creation and dispatch logic from dispatcher.py
- Scout imports and references throughout the codebase

WHY IT WAS REMOVED:
- The new intelligent_search() function provides all Scout functionality
- Gate routing provides better intelligence than Scout's confidence scoring
- Eliminated code duplication and complexity
- Cleaner, more maintainable architecture

OLD WEB SEARCH FLAGS - REPLACED
------------------------------

OLD SYSTEM: Simple boolean "needs_web_search" flag
NEW SYSTEM: Rich "web_search_strategy" object with:
- needed: boolean
- search_priority: "quick" or "thorough"  
- search_query: optimized search terms

This gives much more granular control over search behavior.

       "search_priority": "thorough", 
       "search_query": "latest quantum computing breakthroughs 2025"
     }

3. ROUTING DECISION
   - Since priority is "thorough", route to A.R.C.H./D.E.L.V.E.

4. THOROUGH RESEARCH PIPELINE
   - A.R.C.H. (Research Director) creates investigation plan
   - D.E.L.V.E. (Data Analyst) gathers information using web search tools
   - V.E.T. (Verification) validates and organizes findings
   - S.A.G.E. (Synthesis) creates final comprehensive report
   - Multiple iterations for thoroughness

5. FINAL RESPONSE
   "I've conducted a comprehensive research investigation on quantum computing 
   developments. Here are the findings: [detailed research report with 
   citations and sources]"

ALTERNATIVE FLOW (Quick Search):

1. USER QUERY: "What's the weather like today?"

2. GATE ANALYSIS
