# Testing F.R.E.D. Connection Fixes

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied:**

### ✅ **Database Fix**
- Removed corrupted WAL file: `memory/memory.db.wal`
- This should resolve the DuckDB initialization error

### ✅ **Client Debugging**
- Added debug messages to track data channel creation and states
- Added timeouts and error handling to prevent hanging

### ✅ **Server Debugging**
- Added debug messages to track data channel events on server side
- Added debug info for WebRTC connection process

## 🧪 **Test Steps:**

### 1. **Restart Server** (Database should now initialize properly)
```bash
# Stop current server with Ctrl+C
# Then restart:
python start_fred_with_webrtc.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- ✅ No database errors
- ✅ Server starts cleanly
- ✅ Ngrok tunnel established

### 2. **Test Pi Client** (Should now show detailed debug info)
```bash
# On Pi:
python3 ./pi_client/client.py --server YOUR_NGROK_URL
```

**Expected Debug Output:**
```
🔧 [DEBUG] Data channel created: <RTCDataChannel label=text>
🔧 [DEBUG] Data channel state: connecting
🔗 [CONNECTION] State: connecting
✅ [SUCCESS] WebRTC connection established with local STT
🔗 [CONNECTION] State: connected
🔧 [DEBUG] Data channel state after open: open
📡 [DATA CHANNEL] Connected to F.R.E.D. mainframe
```

**Server Side Expected Output:**
```
🔧 [DEBUG] Data channel event triggered for [IP]
🔧 [DEBUG] Channel label: text, state: open
[PIP-BOY] Data channel 'text' established with field operative at [IP]
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

### If Database Error Still Occurs:
```bash
# Complete database reset:
rm memory/memory.db memory/memory.db.wal
# Restart server
```

### If Data Channel Still Doesn't Open:
- Check for STT service errors on server
- Look for "🔧 [DEBUG]" messages in both client and server
- Check if firewall is blocking WebRTC ports

### If Client Still Hangs:
- Will now show timeout after 30 seconds with debug info
- Check server-side debug messages
- Verify ngrok tunnel is working

## 📊 **Key Debug Points:**

1. **Database Init**: Should see no errors on server start
2. **Data Channel Creation**: Client should show creation immediately 
3. **Data Channel Event**: Server should catch the event
4. **Data Channel Open**: Both sides should confirm opening
5. **STT Ready**: Client should show STT initialization

🎯 **If all debug messages appear correctly, the hanging issue should be resolved!**
